## Overview

Nvidia Omniverse uses the USD system to save scene information. Among that information there is the Material structure, that uses the MDL sintaxys to save textures, values, and properties. This tool is aimed to be a template or a plug and play header library so you can manipulate MDLs, create them, and save them in the format used by Nvidia Omniverse Create.
